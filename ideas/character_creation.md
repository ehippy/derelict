## Character Creation

### STEP 1. ROLL STATS
Characters have four Stats:
Strength, Speed, Intellect, and
Combat, representing how well
they act under extreme pressure.
Roll 2 ten-sided dice (2d10),
add them together, then add
25. Record the results for
each Stat.
A Stat of 36 is average, but don’t
get too hung up on the numbers
right now.

### STEP 2. ROLL SAVES
Characters have three Saves:
Sanity, Fear, and Body,
representing how resistant and
reactive they are to different
kinds of trauma and danger.
Roll 2 ten-sided dice (2d10),
add them together, then add
10. Record the results for
each Save.

### STEP 3. CHOOSE YOUR CLASS

There are four basic classes in Mothership:
Marines are handy in a fight, but whenever they Panic it may
cause problems for the rest of the crew.

Androids are a terrifying and exciting addition to any crew. They
tend to unnerve other crewmembers with their cold inhumanity.

Scientists are doctors, researchers, or anyone who wants to
slice open creatures (or infected crewmembers) with a scalpel.

Teamsters are rough and tumble blue-collar space workers,
mechanics, engineers, miners, and pilots.

Mark your class, then
alter your Stats and Saves
accordingly.

### STEP 4. ROLL HEALTH
Characters can suffer a certain
number of Wounds before they
die. Each class has different
starting Maximum Wounds.
Characters gain a Wound when
their Health reaches zero.
Roll 1 ten-sided die (1d10)
then add 10. Record the result
for Maximum Health.

### STEP 5. GAIN STRESS
Characters’ current Stress and Minimum Stress both start at 2.

### STEP 6. NOTE TRAUMA RESPONSE
Each class deals with Stress
and Panic differently, which
comes into play later in the
game. Mark your Trauma
Response for future reference.

### STEP 7. CHOOSE SKILLS

Each class comes preloaded
with relevant Skills, which help
characters perform better at
different challenges. Additionally,
each class has a number of
bonus Skills to select.
To choose a Skill you must
have at least one prerequisite
Skill (a Skill that has an arrow
pointing from it) first.

> To take a Master or Expert Skill you must first take at least one of its prerequisite Skills.
